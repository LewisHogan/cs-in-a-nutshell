    \section{Environments}

    \subsection{Definitions}
    \begin{definition}
        An environment is a structure used to format blocks of text in \LaTeX~documents.
    \end{definition}

    The definition environment is used to describe new and unfamiliar terms.
    
    \subsection{Notes}

    \begin{note}
        The syntax highlighting plugin being used for this preamble is called \emph{listings}    
    \end{note}

    The note environment is used for additional information that may be of interest to a reader, but should not be essential.

    \subsection{Question}

    \begin{question}
        What is the formula for Pythagoras' theorem?
    \end{question}

    The question environment is used for prompting the user to consider a point of view.

    \subsection{Answer}
    
    \begin{answer}
        The formula for Pythagoras's theorem is \[
          a^2+b^2=c^2  
        \]
        This is frequently used for calculating the \emph{hypotenuse} of any triangle with a right angle.
    \end{answer}

    The answer environment provides a solution for early prompted questions.

    \subsection{Danger}

    \begin{danger}
        To compile \LaTeX~documents you need to make sure you've installed all the required packages! 
    \end{danger}

    The danger environment provides warnings about common pitfalls which make cause issues for the reader.

    \subsection{Exercises}
    
    \begin{exercise}[Hello World!]
        \lstinputlisting[language=C++]{sample_incomplete.cpp}
    \end{exercise}
    Exercises can provide code and feature syntax highlighting.

    \subsection{Solutions}
    \begin{solution}[Hello World!]
        \lstinputlisting[language=C++]{sample_complete.cpp}
    \end{solution}

    Solutions provide the completed code for the corresponding exercise.
